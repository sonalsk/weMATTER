### BASIC STRUCTURE

> *CONTENT DIVISION*

We have divided the content into various categories as stated above. The content, for each category, will be designed in such a way that it is easy to access and comprehend.
For an example, let's explore the Education Category.

*EDUCATION*

Education is one the most crucial factors in the development of person’s life.
To increase the impact of education, we will provide women with the available
resources, scholarships, schemes and facilities by the Government of India.
Information and contact details of nearby schools and colleges will be integrated in
the website via Geolocation API.
